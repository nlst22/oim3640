Learning how to navigate the terminal 
cd folder -> change directory (go into a folder)
cd.. --> go up one level
ls or dir --> list files in the directory 
mkdir folder --> make a new folder 
pwd --> print working directory (where am i?)

*** I need to ask about how to write python from the terminal again **

 **** how did he do the import antigravity ***
- in the terminal itself just type python then when the >>> show up type your line of code 
- but this line of code will not save any where

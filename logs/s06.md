# Session 5 (2/5) - [Function and Interfaces]

## What I learned today
[Brief reflection on key concepts; focus on understanding, not just syntax]
* the diffrence between return and print
- print: you go to shop and just say what you want and forget 
- return: you make a note of what you want 
- print ("Finn says \"Hello!\" to Jake.") # escape quotes within a string

* Immutable: Int

## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
[Paste a snippet and explain what it does]


## Challenges I faced
[What was difficult? How did I approach it?]
* i need to practice how to find the pattern and translate that into code 

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked AI for, how I used/modified the output]

## Questions for next time
[What remains unclear?]
1. from session 06 the 5th review question I was still confused why we cant return message? 
2. Do not understand the draw a square?

# Session 05 (2/3/26) - [Functions]

## What I learned today
[Brief reflection on key concepts; focus on understanding, not just syntax]
* we learned about the importance of the return function when creating a function 
    > if the function does not expliciatly return a vlaue then it will default to none so when you want to use that vlaue later in an expression you will get a nonetype error because you probably used print instead of return 
    > if you will not be using the value from the function later then you can use print


* Recursive function: it is a function that calls itself to solve smaller sub problems of a larger self simmilar problem 
    * 
    import time

    def groundhog_day ():
        """ A function that prints 'groundhog day' every second indefinitely """
        print (Did you mean groundhog day?)
        time.sleep(1)
        if counter == 30:
            pass
        groundhog_day()
    groundhog_day()

* the differenace between an int and float is the decimal
> Int --> 1
> float --> 1.0

* 17 / 5 --> this is regular division > 3.4
* 17 // 5 --> just gives the integer > 3
* 17 % 5 --> gives the remainder > 2

* int, float, string, bool
> boolean --> true or false

* When creating variables you can not have spaces, numbers, or symbols, you can however use _ as a makshift space between words, you also can not use resrved key words (ex: class)


## Code/work I'm proud of (optional)
[Paste a snippet and explain what it does]
please refer to code folder file s05.py for the code we worked on in class

## Challenges I faced
[What was difficult? How did I approach it?]
I was able to follow along well with the class today so not to many difficulties as of yet but I think problems could arrise when I make my own functions and not knowing what values to input outside the function so that you can return the value in an exoression

## AI usage (if any)
[What I asked AI for, how I used/modified the output]
No AI use in class today 

## Questions for next time
[What remains unclear?]
